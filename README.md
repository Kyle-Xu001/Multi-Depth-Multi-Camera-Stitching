- `paranoma_test.py` - Stitch the new image with input stitching combination, using Perspective Transform to stitch the left whole area and the right whole area
- `ImageStitch.py` - Define the `Image` class which combines properties and functions for feature processing on one image, and `Stitch` class which combines properties and functions for matches and features on a pair of images
- `stitch_custom.py` - Given the distortion videos of multiple cameras, utilize the estimated homography parameters generated from `paranoma_test.py` to stitch the image of every frame to create paranoma video
